# Dynamic Topic Modeling

1. First, copy yelp business and reviews json file to the current folder.
2. Then data can be filtered by `python filter.py`. This creates a data folder and a `reviews_restaurants.pkl` file.

The file `reviews_restaurants.pkl` contains two python maps, first which maps review ids to business ids and the second which maps business ids to business names.
